App::IBIS - We have issues.

This is an app initially designed to demo my RDF-KV protocol, but
it has also turned out to be useful for kicking the tires on my IBIS
vocabulary. See http://privatealpha.com/ontology/ibis/1# .

Before you begin, get JQuery by running script/get-jquery, which is a
happy medium between sourcing it on the fly and bundling it in this
project.

Also, be sure to run the Makefile.PL to fetch dependencies. Note: 
Catalyst may complain unless you install Catalyst::Devel via cpan.

You will also need to change the database parameters in app_ibis.conf
to something sane, and note the latest Redland bindings for Perl are
not on CPAN. You can either install it through some other mechanism
(e.g. apt-get or homebrew) or see the RDF::Trine::Store documentation
for alternative storage mechanisms.

When you're ready, run script/app_ibis_server.pl and connect to
http://localhost:3000/ .
